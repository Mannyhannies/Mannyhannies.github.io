					The New York Islanders have not had a dream offseason thus far. They lost a top line player in Pajama Boy, And have not made many signings to make up 
					for their loss. Here is their Additions/Subtractions so far.

					They have added many depth forwards that will help on defense, something the Islanders stuggled on last season. The addition of 
					Lehner will definitely be an upgrade from Jaroslav Halak, but still is a wild card in the sense that he could end up being very 
					solid between the pipes. On paper the Islanders have gotten much worse, it's undeniable. However, one cannot talk about the Isles 
					without mentioning the front office and bench changes. The Islanders have added Stanley Cup-Winning Coach Barry Trotz and have added
					Future Hall of Fame GM Lou Lamoriello at the Helm. They have also poached Goaltending Coach (also known as the Goalie Guru) Mitch 
					Korn, Lane Lambert and other Assistant Coaches from both Toronto and Washington. 
			<p>
					Overall, the Islanders look interesting next year. With the emergence of Barzal as a first line center and returning 40 goal scorer 
					Anders Lee and breakout candidate Anthony Beauvillier, I project the Islanders to be a Wild Card spot competitor. 
					I do believe that Barry Trotz could help fix the Islanders defensive issues.
